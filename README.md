# Talking Ben Discord Bot
aka probably the most close to accurate experience of talking ben on Discord.com

This bot gives you the full experience of the hit game Talking Ben on a chatting service!
~~Im lying this became a trend because of Ishowspeed~~

# How to self-host
This bot is really easy to self host (because it was made to be self hosted)
> All you need is to change the token from config.json from "token" to your bot's token
> And then run it!

Although be sure you have node.js before running "node index.js"..

If it doesn't run then install discord.js, that's really simple to do:
> npm install discord.js --save

The "--save" is optional but you can do it as that'll save it as a global node package.

That's all really, I'm not planning to make it an actual bot because I wrote this to hop on this meme before it dies
#### Plus this bot was created for my friends anyways soooo-
